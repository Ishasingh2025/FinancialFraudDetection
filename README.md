EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Fraud detection is crucial in protecting consumers and businesses from financial losses, yet it often results in frustrating and inconvenient false positives. 
In 2019, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS), in collaboration with Vesta Corporation, launched a Kaggle competition to crowdsource innovative 
fraud detection solutions. This competition advanced fraud detection technology through machine learning (ML) application, encouraging participants to develop more 
accurate and efficient methods for identifying fraudulent transactions. The competition, which offered a $20,000 cash prize, attracted 125,219 model submissions. 
Through this paper, we revisit the dataset from the Kaggle competition to conduct experiments and develop a machine-learning model to optimize the accuracy of fraud detection.



PROBLEM STATEMENT/RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

The New York Times reported that losses from online card fraud reached nearly $8 billion by the end of 2021, an increase from approximately $6 billion in 2019. Due to 
these ongoing increases in credit card fraud and the need to protect customers, banksâ€™ fraud detection systems have become imbalanced, often leading to a poor customer experience.
Many banks disable cards due to false positives, causing inconvenience for legitimate users. Reducing false positives in fraud detection not only improves customer satisfaction but
also contributes to secure digital transactions. This research aims to experiment with various machine learning models to determine which are most effective in addressing this issue.
